Nick has been working on GitHub for years but has only relatively recently started using it to code collaboratively. When he first heard of git/GitHub (as a graduate student) he used it exclusively to track his own solo work. Now that he collaborates with others via GitHub, Nick has a renewed appreciation for the value of version control in team coding work. Nick completed his M.Sc. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University
