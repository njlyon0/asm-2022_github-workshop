# All Scientists’ Meeting - GitHub Workshop

### Co-led by Angel Chen & [Nick J Lyon](https://njlyon0.github.io/)

This repository includes all of the content for the workshop entitled
**“Reproducible & Collaborative Coding with Git”**
to be presented at the 2022 LTER [All Scientists’
Meeting](https://lternet.edu/2022-all-scientists-meeting/). The live website can be found [here](https://njlyon0.github.io/asm-2022_github-workshop/).

## Workshop Abstract:

This workshop will offer attendees an overview of the fundamentals of git (and one of its associated web user interfaces: GitHub) followed by a demonstration of a git-centric workflow in RStudio. Attendees will be provided with optional instructions on pre-workshop set-up for preparing their own laptops but the workshop is structured to maximize value without attendees taking those steps. Emphasis will be on broadly accessible, jargon-free communication and only a web browser and RStudio will be used (i.e., no “command line” / “shell” / “terminal” experience is necessary). After this workshop attendees will be able to (1) outline the fundamentals of the git workflow, (2) create a repository on GitHub, (3) clone that repository to their local machine using RStudio.
