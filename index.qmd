**Welcome to the 2022 All Scientists' Meeting workshop "Reproducible & Collaborative Coding with Git"!** We are excited to have you with us for this training whether you are a veteran version control user or this is your first foray into the world of `git` and GitHub.

While we will be demonstrating using `git` with RStudio today you do NOT need to set up your computer to follow along. That said, we have included instructions on how to get your computer set up *if* that is of interest.

### Let's Get To It!

We aim to make this training fun, informative, and not overly terrifying so please reach out if you have any questions before, during, or after the workshop! Our contact information is listed below:
