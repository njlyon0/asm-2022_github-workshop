**Welcome to the 2022 All Scientists' Meeting workshop "Reproducible & Collaborative Coding with Git"!** We are excited to have you with us for this training whether you are a veteran version control user or this is your first foray into the world of `git` and GitHub.

While we will be demonstrating using `git` with RStudio today you do NOT need to set up your computer to follow along. That said, we have included instructions on how to get your computer set up *if* that is of interest.

## Workshop Outline*

*Note that the specific timing may differ on the day depending on questions and conversations with you all but this is our planned timing.
